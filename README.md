Solution title: Concept solution for an open centralized system of agriculture and rural development data 

The complex sector of agriculture with complex ministry internal organization (veterinary and food safety, crop and animal production, rural development, etc.) and agencies gather a lot of business data from farms and other data ecosystems.
Several data sources of the agricultural sector in Croatia are available: Ministry of Agriculture (https://poljoprivreda.gov.hr/), Open Data Portal of the Republic of Croatia (https://data.gov.hr/), Croatian Agriculture and Food Agency (https://www.hapih.hr/), Paying Agency for Agriculture, Fisheries and Rural Development (https://www.apprrr.hr/), Croatian Bureau of Statistics (https://dzs.gov.hr/). Furthermore, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of Croatia provides specific (not opened) databases such as Hagris, Honey of the Croatian apiaries, VetIS, etc. Most of the available raw and aggregated data are in .pdf formats, with limited or absent search/filter options or visualization. In addition, some information is available only on request or registration where the instructions are not provided.
While it takes a lot of resources to create such databases and organize a machine-readable collection of data, our initiative includes the creation of a centralized open data system within the agricultural sector. The main purposes of such a system would be an improvement in coordination between the public sector and citizens, more efficient decision – making management of public funds, and transparency of public services based on open data analysis.
